In this course we will employ git as project management tool for teaching, training 
and excercising. We highly recommand that our students use github as daily used 
remote repositories for course learning, for the convenience of resource 
searching and management from the whole github programmer's community. In the 
meanwhile you may use gitee as a main backup source of remote repositories.

From [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
you may download the most recent version of git and then make default installation.

### 2.1 SSH Connection


Use git tools to manage projects, often using SSH to connect to code repositories. 
How to install win10 SSH client please refer:

[Install SSH on Win10](git/ssh_client.md)


Generate and use ssh-key:

[Please refer to ssh-key](git/ssh_gitee.md)
